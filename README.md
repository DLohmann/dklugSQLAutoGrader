# dklugSQLAutoGrader
An all-in-one shell script to auto grade lab output files for Databases Fall 2018 UC Merced

Change the folder it pulls results from depending on which lab you're working on

This started out as a combination of two separate scripts I wrote found here:
 * https://github.com/dklug/sqlTester
 * https://github.com/dklug/DiffChecker

I also use this script to split up one large sql file by line into the 1.sql, 2.sql ... files for lab:
